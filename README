This program creates an 11x11 hexboard and randomly fills up the hexes with a player. After the board
is filled, a breadth-first-search is performed to find the winner.
Should be working fine.
In this program, we learned how to play the game hex and how to implement a hexboard as well as print it out.
We all worked on this together and contributed equally.
To compile, type "make all". To run the program, type "main".

This program uses a 2D matrix to represent the hexboard.
The board is printed with the overloaded << operator and the player that owns the hex is filled in.
